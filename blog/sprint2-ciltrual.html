                To start a long term goal of mine to get a place where I can hide from the world for a time and that no one can find me the easiest
                 way to do this is most likely by getting a job saving up money buying land and living underground like some kind of mole person but
                  that is a long time off yet and I have a lot of short term things I want to get done first, so that can wait for now but saving up
                   for that now is always a good idea.

                While at EDA I think I would like to develop my skills for getting help, I've always had a hard time asking for help and maybe this
                 place can help me work on that. Studying at this place will definitely be hard enough to warrant needing help so now  is a good a
                  time as any to start working on the ability to ask for it when needed.

                To my advantage I am very stubborn,very smart (most of the time), and I am highly independent. However these three thing at the same
                 time are very harsh limitations expectantly when it comes to learning.

                Because I am smart and stubborn I manage work by taking one task at a time and completing what I
                 consider the easier tasks first and harder ones last, with my stubbornness I will not give up until I get the answer.
                  In order to get the answer I will use every resource at my disposal and talking to others tends to help cement my understanding of a given topic.

                My current way of seeking out help is a little flawed but so far seems to work out,
                 I spend two hours trying to solve the problem my self, then I give my self 1 hour with a search engine to finding the answer and 
                 if that fails then I ask someone to help.

                From the facilitation team I expect a calm and understanding attitude,
                 for them to be knowledgeable enough to point me it the right direction for me to find and understand the answer and not just
                  say this is what happens because raisins. And in failing all that to at least be helpful in showing me whats expected to move on to better things.
