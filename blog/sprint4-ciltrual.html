             <b>Neuroplasticity.</b>
             <br> To give a bit of background neuroplasticity is the brains ability to rewire
              itself with some work, it can also be used by people with some kinds of brain
              damage like people who have had a stroke to re train their brain to do some
              tasks that they cant do because of it. Now because of how the brain works if you 
              understand how neuroplasticity works and with some effort you can train yourself 
              to do things almost anything. Now neuroplasticity is useful to understand and 
              knowing a little more about it means I can start to understand why I do some 
              things and how it leads me to learn new things, I put things in to context to 
              understand how things fit together and to makes learning things a little easier. 
              some of the ways to increase you neuroplasticity include reparation, if you 
              repeat a task over and over again the brain will create neural path ways that 
              make that task easier, you could also link the raw information to a context or 
              already cemented knowledge in your head, its easier to recall larger chunks of 
              information that small or individual bits of information.

                <b>The growth mindset.</b>
                <br>Now the growth mindset is the belief that a person can change over time or 
                learn things they are not good at, this is directly opposed be the fixed mind 
                set which is the belief that people are only good at some things and some 
                things are impossible for some people to learn. In learning about both mind 
                sets I discovered something interesting I hold both mindsets depending on how 
                lazy I feel toward the topic, the key thing to remember is you can learn 
                anything it just depends on how much effort you are willing to put in. while 
                going through this I know I can use the growth mindset to my advantage, I know 
                I can learn this it just needs me to put in enough effort to do this but but I 
                know I can do this.
