            o start I need to explain an ethical decision I had to make.
             Now this alone is hard enough to do as decisions that draw my ethics in to question are rare for me,
              that or they appear frequently and I don't take too long to think on them but here goes.
               A few years ago a friend and I were having a conversation and the topic of his girlfriend had come up,
                this was not uncommon as at the time she was basically his whole world and for her part when they were together she could do no wrong in his eyes.
                 However at the time I had recently learned that she was unfaithful and that had been going on for a while when they were together,
                  I have a very short fuse when it comes to both lairs and traitors and this girl was both,
                   so there was the choice sit and do nothing or tell him that the person who held his heart was playing with it
                   . Being who I am and that the topic had just come up I told him the truth now the conversation is kind of foggy in my mind but I know the outcome he hit me, just once,
                    then told me never talk bad about his girlfriend again then stopped talking to be about a year. What happened or so I heard a few weeks after that happened he started asking questions that she didn't want to answer and he eventually caught her with someone else.
                     Everyone who gets to know me learns real quick I'm always going to be honest with them even if it hurts.

            Your culture is based on the people you hang round be it family or friends or the people you work with,
             the people I kept close constantly changed but I always had animals around be it cats or dogs sometimes it was birds my core values
              and what I based my identity on comes from them, animals were always honest and trusting and could be incredibly loyal if you treated them well and so that's how I based my core be honest and be loyal.
           </p>
           <p>
            The animals also influence my values I learnt to value freedom form birds
            , from dogs I learnt stubbornness can sometimes be a very useful in getting what you want but also know when to drop it even if its the only thing you want in the world at that moment,
             and the value of tolerance from cats the put up with something up until the don't and you can usually see that last part coming from a good while away.
           </p>

            I can be very stubborn when it comes to learning things,
             at times I will sit for hours trying to understand a problem until I get it,
              the only problem is that that stubbornness can lead me to getting stuck for longer than I should be cause I know I can get it I just need a little more time,
               even if the easiest way to get unstuck is just to ask for help.
