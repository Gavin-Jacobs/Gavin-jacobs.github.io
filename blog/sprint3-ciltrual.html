                emotional intelligence while being a very complicated topic it can be reduced to a few lines,
                 the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others.
                  Its a measure of empathy and the ability to use emotions to assist in tasks and solve problems,
                   this can be seen in leadership rolls and when working in a group.

             <p class="segment-text">    EQ is different from IQ with the simple fact that IQ can be a measure of mechanical intelligence EQ is a measure
                 how connected you are to your emotions and how you understand emotions. While mechanical knowledge can be very good when on task

                          Having a good grasp of emotional intelligence can be useful in the deescalation and resolution of 
                conflicts as well as bonding with people in personal relationships and working well with team members. 
                EQ can also be very useful as a team lead when it comes to understanding the views and ideas the people you lead are coming from. 
                It can also be very useful for personal development as if you know why you feel a certain way and do not like it you can figure out 
                whats causing you to feel that way and find ways to change it.
