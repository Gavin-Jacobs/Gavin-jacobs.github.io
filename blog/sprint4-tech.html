            <b>A simple problem.</b>
                Some time back my family needed to start a fire however there was a small problem the wood was wet, well not wet but damp,
                however this became my problem when they tasked me with starting the fire.
                The last person who was tasked with starting the fire just succeeded in smoking out the neighbor and creating a lot of paper ash.
                After being given the task the others left me alone and did other things being outside meant the only person who was with me
                during this task was a pair of dogs, in order to solve this problem I started talking to the dogs listing off what needed to
                happen to get this fire started. I needed to start a small fire with kindling, then I needed to get it burning hot enough to
                dry out the less damp wood to get longer lasting fuel, and lastly get the fire to a point that it can be used to cook on.
                Not exactly an easy task but it was a simple task start a fire, so after having a conversation with the dogs about what
                needed to be done and getting the fire started I remember feeling annoyed both at at the fact the wood was damp and 
                wouldn't work with me and that they left me to do this stupid task alone. If I learned anything from this story its people 
                will always try to get someone else to fix their god damn problems for them

           <b>an elegant solution to a problem.</b>
            So four of us are having an argument about a nonsense topic (the topic is now both a repressed memory and a forbidden thing to
            bring up), and even though those in the argument were friends the way the argument was going some were not going to stay that
            way for long. So feeling bad for starting this fight and just watching this unfold I had one of the most brilliant ideas I have
            ever had if we cant agree on something we like we can at least unite against something we all hate. Form that story I learnt
            two things, one don't start an argument with nerds about silly topics because it may come to blows and two no one in that group
            likes elves.
