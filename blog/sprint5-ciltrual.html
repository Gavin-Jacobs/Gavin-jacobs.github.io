                <b>three things I have learnt about my self</b>

                <br>first I listen in conversations, I listen a lot and well its strange.
                Second I have a lot of characteristic of a dog not all of the traits are bad.
                Third the more you look inward the more there is to understand.
            </p>    
            <p>   
                <br><b>The role of values empathy and self awareness in learning and programming.</b>
                
                <br>Empathy and values are an important part of programming as being a part of a team or working with others is a big part of programming, 
                even if its just by yourself you can use them when dealing with others in order to solve problems. While self awareness can help in programming 
                it is very important in learning as being self aware can help understand why some things are hard to learn, when the best time for you to study 
                or even increase productivity.
            </p>
            <p>    
                <br><b>What surprised me about the core learning.</b>
                
                <br>The thing that most surprised me is that some of the things I did in my personal; life to understand others had names emotional inelegance 
                understanding the emotions of others is not just empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><b>Challenging aspects of core learning.</b>
                
                <br>The most challenging part of learning the core skills is overcoming the bias against some of them and thinking they aren't worth learning. 
                However after looking in to them I found some ideas quite useful.
            </p>    
            <p>
                <br><b>Why does EDA spend time on core skills.</b>
                
                <br>I think EDA spends so much time on the core shills because they 
            </p>     
            <p>
                <br><b>Does the time spent studying core skills feel like a waste of time.</b>
                
                <br>Well yes and no, its complicated. Some of the things that were studied were less than useful while others were very useful.  for instance the 
                mindfulness things while useful didn't help me with anything and felt like people trying to push something on me but that's most likely because I 
                encountered prior and it was just some people trying to push something. While the things on emotional awareness and emotional intelligence was very 
                useful in understanding some of the things I do and helped in my understandings of others.

                <b>My long term goal.</b>

                <br> I'm not too sure just of yet, but right one my longest term goal is to become a programmer and then to think more on it after I have started.
            </p>   
            <p>
                <b>My biggest strengths and limitations.</b>

                <br>I feel my biggest strengths is the facts that I am both smart and highly independent leading me to be able learn quickly and stand on my own.
                 However being both smart and independent leads me to get stuck on strange problems and finding it very hard to ask for help when I encounter
                 these problems.
            </p>     
            <p>
                <b>The biggest problem with the non-technical challenge.</b>
                
                <br>My biggest non tech challenge during this boot camp will most likely be something to do with public speaking or presenting just because I get a
                 little nervous  when talking to groups of people so I start to speed up my speech  or forget some of the finer points I was meant to push across.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>My Exceptions of me in boot camp.</b>

                <br>I expect myself to seek help more  from the people who are going through this with me seeing physical people. I find it easier to talk to people
                 face to face rather than indirectly over the internet.

                <br>Timetables, timetables and timetables, in order to manage my workload I will keep timetables to keeps me on track with work.
