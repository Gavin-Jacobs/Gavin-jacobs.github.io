            <b>HTML and CSS, some differences</b>
            while you could make a website with html alone you cant really do the same with CSS.
             to put it another way if the html of a page is the bones of a human body the css is like its skin,
             with bones you can still tell it was a person but with just shin its not really clear what it is.

           <b>Control flow and loops</b>
            <br>to put things in simple terms control flow is the order in which things are done and loops are how many times that task is repeated
            <br>putting this in to practse lets say you are planting a flower garden the flow is pick spot, dig hole, place plant, fill hole, done
            the loop is repeat un till you have a row of ten flowers

           <b>What is the DOM</b>
           <br>The DOM is the document object model and its the interface that you can use to edit webpage on your machine, it only changes on your machine but you can do some interesting things with it.
            with this you can edit the page and adjust elements to make it look or say anything you want and it wont effect anyone else, it can also be used to test page layouts change padding and margin distances and change the color of all the different things on the page.<br>it makes changing things on the css and html pages easire because you will know what a change does before you commit to it in the editor

           <b>Access data from arrays or objects</b>
            <br>form what i understand arrays can hold a hole range of data and if set right anything could pull from them but if you were going to pull data from an object first you need to refrence the (object call its name) then you need to pull its data.
            <br>that being said some ojects can have arrays in them while arrays can only hold values

           <b>What is a Function?</b>
            <br>A function is more or less just a block of code that does a task.
            <br>These task can range from very simple tasks take one imput and add it to another, to very complex such as taking one number adding another to it and if its ever a multpul of lets say five instead of giving you the number it says "the sky is falling"
            <br>this can be very useful because a properly setup code can be copied then some of its parts replaced easily to do slightly different tasks, or they can be looped so that they do the tasks thousands of times without us needing to the same thing over a thousand times, functions are also useful in setting up automaton of small mundane tasks.
