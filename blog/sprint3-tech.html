            <b>HTML and CSS, some differences</b>
            while you could make a website with html alone you cant really do the same with CSS.
             to put it another way if the html of a page is the bones of a human body the css is like its skin,
             with bones you can still tell it was a person but with just shin its not really clear what it is.

           <b>Control flow and loops</b>
            to put things in simple terms control flow is the order in which things are done and loops are how many times that task is repeated
            putting this in to practse lets say you are planting a flower garden the flow is pick spot, dig hole, place plant, fill hole, done
            the loop is repeat un till you have a row of ten flowers

           <b>What is the DOM</b>
            The DOM is the document object model and its the interface that you can use to edit webpage on your machine, it only changes on your machine but you can do some interesting things with it.
            with this you can edit the page and adjust elements to make it look or say anything you want and it wont effect anyone else, it can also be used to test page layouts change padding and margin distances and change the color of all the different things on the page.<br>it makes changing things on the css and html pages easire because you will know what a change does before you commit to it in the editor

            <br>the margin is the space between elements so the pink space between this box and the last box
            <br>this is good for spacing articles or images
